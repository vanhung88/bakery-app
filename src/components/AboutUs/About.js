            I think in the darkest moments, we need a break. I always say: To be
            well dressed you must be well naked. I don’t really know how to do
            casual clothes. Fashion moves so quickly that, unless you have a
            strong point of view, you can lose integrity. Men have got more of
            adiscerning eye. They appreciate cut and details, things that aren’t
            so obvious. I can design a collection in a day and I always do,
            cause I’ve always got a load of Italians on my back, moaning that
            it’s late. I believe in comfort. If you don’t feel comfortable in
            your clothes, it’s hard to think of anything else. Fashion moves so
            quickly that, unless you have a strong point of view, you can lose
            integrity. You have to always work against what you did before, and
            even against your taste. You have to stay true to your heritage;
            that’s what your brand is about. Dressing is a way of life. I always
            say:
            <span class="text-2">
              To be well dressed you must be well naked. I like things simple.

            Herb let don’t fish gathering. Yielding female kind creepeth sixth

            I remember walking the dog one day, I saw a car full of teenage girls, and one of them rolled down the window and yelled, ‘Marc Jacobs!’ in a French accent. A girl should be two things: classy and fabulous. Men have got more of a discerning eye. They appreciate cut and details, things that aren’t so obvious. They like things that have cachet and gentlemanliness. Fashion fades, only style remains the same. A woman has the age she deserves. I am not interested in the past, except as the road to the future. My learning process is by eye alone; it’s not.
